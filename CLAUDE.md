# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal codebase consisting of:

- Empty `src/` directory for source code
- Empty `Plan/` directory for planning documents
- Empty `Readme.md` file
- Development container configuration for Node.js environment

- "master" is the main branch.

## Development Environment

This repository uses a Docker development container with:

- Node.js 20 runtime
- Claude Code CLI pre-installed
- Development tools: git, zsh, fzf, nano, vim, gh CLI
- Network tools: iptables, ipset, iproute2, dnsutils
- VSCode extensions: ESLint, Prettier, GitLens configured

## Project Structure

Currently minimal with placeholder directories:

- `src/` - Source code (empty)
- `Plan/` - Planning documents (empty)
- `.devcontainer/` - Development container configuration
- `.claude/` - Claude Code settings

## Development Workflow

No build scripts, test commands, or package management files are currently present. This appears to be a fresh repository setup waiting for project initialization.

When working in this repository, you may need to:

1. Initialize the appropriate project structure based on the intended technology stack
2. Add package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) as needed
3. Set up build and test commands once the project type is determined
